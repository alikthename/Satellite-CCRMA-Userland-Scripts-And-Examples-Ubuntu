# Set the ethernet interface to always have the static IP address
# 192.168.105.106.  This is the default configuration for Satellite
# CCRMA.  If ethernet interface is set to have this static IP, then
# you will need to have your laptop's ethernet interface to use 
# the static IP address 192.168.105.105, and then you can log in to
# your kit using: ssh -XY ccrma@192.168.105.106
